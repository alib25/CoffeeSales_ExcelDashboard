**Project Overview:**
The aim of this project is to provide high level analysis of sales and insights into transaction records data and performance metrics for a fictional coffee shop, Maven Roasters, to its stakeholders. The fictitious coffee shop is operating out of three NYC locations. The end-users, in this case, the stakeholders, should be capable of discerning:

- Monthly sales and transaction trends
- Peak sales periods
- Best-selling menu items by quantity sold

**Some Business Questions:**
1. What are the KPI values for individual product_category?
2. Did the company meet its Units Sold goal for each product group for the month?
3. What are the KPI values for individual store locations?

**Data Source:**
The data set can be found and been accessed from Maven Analytics and on Kaggle. 

**KPIs Tracked:**
- Number of Transactions
- Total Sales in Dollars
- Total Units of Coffee Sold

**Exploratory Analysis**
My initial focus involved a thorough examination of the tables to acquaint myself with the various fields and conduct any requisite cleaning. No cleaning was needed in these particular tables, given the relatively clean nature of the initial dataset.The subsequent step entailed breaking down the 'transaction_date' column into separate 'Month', 'Weekday', and 'Hour' tables. Furthermore, I divided the 'product_detail' column into 'item' and 'size'.

- I created bar charts to represent distribution of sales transaction throughout the day. One chart depicted the hour of the day and the other for days of the week. And additional chart was created to track the transactions by product cateogry.

- To display items within each product, I created Pivot Tables. I also examined the top 15 products and the revenue generated by each.

**Business Questions:**
1. Coffee and Tea beverages constitute the majority of all Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). While Bakery items and Drinking Chocolate also contribute significantly in terms of revenue and units sold, they are comparatively less profitable. These items certainly attract customers and should remain on the menu.
2. The company exceeded its target in the beverages category by 20% but fell short of targets in other groups. Despite this, the overall impact is positive, given previous observations that highlight beverages as the most profitable and business-driving segment. Refining the inventory is a good plan going forward.
3. Among the stores, Store 8 stands out as the leader across all KPIs. Although Store 5 has the next highest transactions, it performs less favorably than Store 3 in other KPIs. This suggests that Store 5 serves more customers and has the potential to generate more profit if the staff is trained to promote more profitable items

**Summary**
- Beverages such as coffee and tea drive the profit of the business, and stores that place emphasis on these items.
- Ethiopian and Brazilian coffees are the most popular flavors, while Jamaican Coffee River generates more sales.
- Packaged Chocolate is the least ordered item.
- On weekends the stores have significantly less revenue than during the weekdays.
- Monday, Thursday, and Friday mornings generate the most sales.

**Recommendations**
- Store staff experience levels should be analyzed to see if more experienced staff tend to drive more profitable sales.
- Adjusting the hours of operation to account for the sales difference on weekends and after 7pm on weekdays. It may be necessary to reduce these hours.
- An examination should be conducted on customer demographics, including age and gender, to identify correlations between these demographics and purchasing patterns. This entails understanding which customer segments frequent the coffee shop more often, which groups tend to purchase more items during each visit, and which demographics are more inclined to buy the most profitable items.
